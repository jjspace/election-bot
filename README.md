# Fiddle Bot

This bot includes the ability to create and track nominations for any number of positions. Managers can create positions and add descriptions to them. Then other users can nominate members for any of the created positions.

There are plans to incorporate commands to help with running an actual election with private ballots in members DMs but that is not currently implemented. What is implemented is a way to generate a random order for nominees to give speeches. This is based off how the group I built this for handles elections.

Currently it requires a `config.js` file exporting settings used by the bot. I'm not going to outline the structure yet because there's still potential for it to change moving forward.
